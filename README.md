# Google Ads Block

This repository contains views and explores used for the Google Ads Block dashboards.
There are 5 dashboards that come with this block: Google Adwords Overview, Google Adwords - Clicks,
Google Adwords - Conversions, Google Adwords - Impressions and Google Adwords - Spend. Each of the dashboards
provides in-depth analysis of ad/campaign performance over a given timeframe.

This project is remotely included through the Google Ads Block Config project.
